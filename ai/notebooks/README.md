# Notebook Experimentation
Generally when I (Seth) do data science I like to experiment with 
things before I commit to how I will run the training and inference 
part of the code. This area contains all of the experimentation. 
Below you will find instructions on how to run the notebooks locally
along with what each notebook contains.

## Running Notebooks
1. `cd` into this folder
2. Run the command  `jupyter notebook`
3. Profit

## logodata.ipynb
This notebook downloads the logo data that was used in the
customvision.ai demo.

## dataprep.ipynb
This notebook downloads cat and dog image data used to train the
main model.

## model.ipynb
This notebook loads the cat and dog data created by 
`dataprep.ipynb` and creates a predictive model.

## inference.ipynb
This notebook uses the cat and dog model generated by
`model.ipynb` and does the actual inferencing on the
model.

## rotator.ipynb
This notebook was added to test out custom image rotation
for use in the rotator model created for detecting improper
image rotation.

## bingimages module
This module contains the code that downloads the images
from bing. It is used in the `logodata.ipynb` and `dataprep.ipynb`
notebooks.
